Core conformance checks for `hex-matrix` (the dense base).

Run this file through the conformance Lake target, not direct `lake env lean`.

Oracle: none
Mode: always
Covered operations:
- dense matrix constructors and accessors (`ofFn`, `row`, `col`, `transpose`, `principalSubmatrix`)
- vector and matrix arithmetic (`dotProduct`, ``.normSq, `mulVec`, `mul`, `gramMatrix`)
- elementary row operations (`rowSwap`, `rowScale`, `rowAdd`)
Covered properties:
- transpose is involutive on committed fixtures
- identity matrices act as left and right multiplicative identities
- `rowSwap` is involutive
Covered edge cases:
- zero matrices and zero vectors, identity matrices, 2×2 and 6×6 dimension bands

The determinant, Bareiss, and row-reduction conformance guards live in the
`HexDeterminant`, `HexBareiss`, and `HexRowReduce` Conformance modules.
