The `HexMatrix` library exposes the dense matrix core: the `Vector`-based
matrix representation, basic vector helpers, the dot product, dense matrix
algebra, elementary row/column operations, and submatrix/Gram helpers. The
row-echelon transforms, determinant APIs, and the executable Bareiss algorithm
live in the `HexRowReduce`, `HexDeterminant`, and `HexBareiss` libraries.
